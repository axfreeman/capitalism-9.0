<h2>Welcome</h1>
<p>Here, you build industries.</p>

<p>To create a new industry, press the '+' button and you will be asked to fill in enough detail to make it. This minimal information is likely to be insufficient to ensure the industry will function properly; you can fill this out by editing the table above.</p>

<p>Or, you can load a simulation that has already been defined, and either modify it or simply run it, to see what it does.</p>

<p>An industry is any group of enterprises, or productive units, who make the same commodity using the same technology. More than one industry can produce the same commodity.</p>

<p>Industries use 'inputs' which are other commodities, used to make their product. Labour is an input to most industries. You can control which inputs an industry needs when you fill out its details.</p>
