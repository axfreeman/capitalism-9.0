# Capitalism 9.0 announcements 2/22/2018 9:17:19 AM

Icon-styled graphic interface (That's what all the restructuring was for).
New Executable.
New user guide on the way

## 2/23/2018 3:20:18 PM 

All benchmark projects working except low initial MELT.
This now includes profit rate equalization (phew).
To ensure equalization conforms to what is generally (and IMO wrongly) published, money is not included in the equalization.
This is principally for tutorial purposes.
Next up: including money, to illustrate the need for the correction. 
Some changes in functionality.
Hence new executable.
User Guide now slightly out of date.
Tutorial still under way.

Code tidy. Comprehensive tooltips.

A tutorial, intended to be the first of several, is under way. To facilitate this, the main tables have been moved around; as a result, some of the illustrations in the user guide itself are mildly out of date.

There are now eight projects. The eighth allows for multiple productive inputs, as a prelude to dealing with profit equalization

The five benchmark projects are working (see below), also Simple Reproduction with two production goods.

New executable ('capitalism.exe')

Capitalism 9.0 starts where a previous version, capitalism-8.0, left off. The older version is a working prototype that reached a watershed; it contains a lot of development code which is not especially interesting. However, the old version is archived if users want to study the genesis and history of the app.

It contains seven 'projects' which (in principle) serve the following purposes:

1. They  comprise a set of tests to make sure the app works.
2. They provide worked examples so the user can learn the app.
3. They illustrate important principles in economics.

Of these, four are now working
1. Simple Reproduction (basic introduction: the simplest possible example of a working economy)
2. Simple Reproduction with halved period (shows the relation between stocks, flows, and turnover time)
3. Simple Reproduction with low initial MELT (illustrates a temporal process)
4. Expanded Reproduction (illustrates accumulation and a number of other features)
5. Simple Reproduction with two consumption goods

The goal is to complete work on
6. Profit Rate equalization
7. Dynamic market adjustment (the original simulation)
8. Expanded Reproduction with changing technology

The data for project 8 have not yet been incorporated
