This is a watershed version to go with the tutorial (in the 'docs' folder), which is progressing though incomplete. 
There has been a general tidy-up which makes clear what needs to be fixed as we progress.
Minor improvements to functionality

A tutorial, intended to be the first of several, is under way. To facilitate this, the main tables have been moved around; as a result, some of the illustrations in the user guide itself are mildly out of date.

There are now eight projects. The eighth allows for multiple productive inputs, as a prelude to dealing with profit equalization

The code for accumulation has been substantially upgraded to deal with multiple means of production.

The code now accomodates multiple industries producing the same commodity.

The five benchmark projects are working (see below).

New executable ('capitalism.exe')

Capitalism 9.0 starts where a previous version, capitalism-8.0, left off. The older version is a working prototype that reached a watershed; it contains a lot of development code which is not especially interesting. However, the old version is archived if users want to study the genesis and history of the app.

It contains seven 'projects' which (in principle) serve the following purposes:

1. They  comprise a set of tests to make sure the app works.
2. They provide worked examples so the user can learn the app.
3. They illustrate important principles in economics.

Of these, four are now working
1. Simple Reproduction (basic introduction: the simplest possible example of a working economy)
2. Simple Reproduction with halved period (shows the relation between stocks, flows, and turnover time)
3. Simple Reproduction with low initial MELT (illustrates a temporal process)
4. Expanded Reproduction (illustrates accumulation and a number of other features)
5. Simple Reproduction with two consumption goods

The goal is to complete work on
6. Profit Rate equalization
7. Dynamic market adjustment (the original simulation)
8. Expanded Reproduction with changing technology

The data for project 8 have not yet been incorporated
