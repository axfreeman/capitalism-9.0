Capitalism 9.0 starts where a previous version, capitalism-8.0, left off. The older version is a working prototype that reached a watershed; it contains a lot of development code which is not especially interesting. However, the old version is archived if users want to study the genesis and history of the app.

It contains eight benchmark projects which (in principle) serve the following purposes:

1. They  comprise a set of tests to make sure the app works.
2. They provide worked examples so the user can learn the app.
3. They illustrate important principles in economics.
