Capitalism 9.0 starts where a previous version, capitalism-8.0, left off. The older version is a working prototype that reached a watershed; it contains a lot of development code which is not especially interesting. However, the old version is archived if users want to study the genesis and history of the app.

It contains five 'projects' which (in principle) serve the following purposes:

1. They  comprise a set of tests to make sure the app works.
2. They provide worked examples so the user can learn the app.
3. They illustrate important principles in economics.

The transition to capitalism-9.0 took place when some new features were being incorporated. At the start point, only project 1 was working.

	Projects 2 and 3 go slightly wrong (though a working version can be found in the capitalism-8.0 archive); I aim to restore these to working condition before proceeding with project 5
	Project 4 is a full-blown simulation that isn't working yet in this version (it worked in 1992)
	Project 5 is undergoing testing at this time.
