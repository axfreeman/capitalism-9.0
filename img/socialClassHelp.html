		<p>This minimal information is likely to be insufficient to ensure

		<h3>Definition</h3>
		<p>
			A social class is a group of people with a similar type of income or
			<em>revenue</em>, for example workers whose revenue comes from wages,
			or capitalists whose revenue derives from profit. You can specify
			where a class's revenue comes from.
		</p>

		<p>Social Classes own, and consume, consumer goods, according to
			rules which you can control.</p>
		<p>
			a social class can have mixed revenue, for example small landholders
			or shopkeepers. the <i>participation ratio</i> specifies what
			proportion of this class's revenue comes from wages.
