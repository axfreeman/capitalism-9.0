	<p align="center">A commodity is anything that is bought and sold.
		Some theories adopt stricter definitions; this App has space for you
		to provide your own definition.</p>
	<p align="center">
		It distinguishes four types of commodities. A commodity is either
		destined to be consumed, in which case its <i>function</i> is a <b>Consumer
			Good</b>, or to be used to produce other commodities, in which case its
		function is a <b>Productive Input</b>.
	</p>
	<p align="center">
		A commodity can either be produced by an industry, in which case its <i>origin</i>
		is <b>Industrial</b>, or it can be produced by a social class, in
		which case its origin is <b>Social</b>. A commodity may not be
		produced at all, for example some types of money.
