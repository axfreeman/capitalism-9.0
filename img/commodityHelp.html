		</p>
		<p>Any social classes or industries that consume or produce it
			will be created automatically. When you have created a commodity, you
			can edit its details in the table above.</p>
		<p>You may also have to edit the industries, and social classes,
			that use or produce it.</p>
		<p>You can also edit a simulation that has already been defined,</p>
		<p>In all cases you can save the result, and run it from the
			simulation.</p>
		<h3>Definitions</h3>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Commodity: </em></strong>In this App, a commodity is
			anything that is bought and sold. Some theories adopt stricter
			definitions
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Function</em>: </strong>if a commodity is&nbsp; consumed,
			it is a <b>Consumer Good</b>. If it is used to produce other
			commodities, it is a <b>Productive Input</b>. Since a commodity has a
			definite single use, it cannot have two functions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some commodities are neither consumed nor used to produce other
			commodities, for example some types of <strong>money</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em><strong> Origin: </strong></em>If a commodity is produced by an
			industry, its origin is <b>Industrial</b>. If it is produced by a
			social class, its origin is <b>Social</b>. In this app, a commodity
			cannot have two origins. This may change.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some commodity are not produced at all, for example some types of <strong>money</strong>.
