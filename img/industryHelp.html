		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>Here, you build industries</p>

		<p>
			To create a new industry, press <img src="littlePlus.png" alt=""
				title="littleplus" style="width: 13px; height: 13px;">; you
			will be asked to fill in enough detail to make this industry.
		</p>
		<p>This minimal information may be insufficient to ensure the
			industry will function properly; you should add further detail in the
			table above.</p>
		<p>You can also load a simulation that has already been defined,
			and either modify it or simply run it, to see what it does.</p>
		<h3>Definition</h3>
		<p>An industry is any group of enterprises, or productive units,
			who make the same commodity using the same technology. More than one
			industry can produce the same commodity.</p>
		<p>Industries use 'inputs' which are other commodities, used to
			make their product. Labour is an input to most industries. You can
			control which inputs an industry needs when you fill out its details.</p>
